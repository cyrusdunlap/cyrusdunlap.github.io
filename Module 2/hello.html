<p>     They have had the majority of their success since the mid 1980's.  Have had the pleasure of having
    two of the greatest players to ever skate be captains of the team.  The team almost went bankrupt
    in the late 1990's and the team was purchased by former player and hall of famer Mario Lemieux.  
    This started the rebuild that turned out 3 more Stanley Cups.
